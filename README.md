This is a dlqr algorithm starting from 0 with python through two different approaches: riccati euqation and reinforcement learning.

Update: 2024/6/1 I also add the gain matrix computed with continuous lqr to compare their results. 

Update: 2024/6/2 The animation is also improved with the ball's trace and the diagrams of the state matrix at different time.
